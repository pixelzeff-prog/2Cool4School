<h1>A bit about some of my plants</h1>

<h4>Roy</h4>
<p id="roy">One of my <em>favorite</em> plants is my aloe vera plant thats named Roy. He's one of my favorite's because Roy's gel on the inside of his leaves can really help your skin feel better. Especially from sun burns. Roy also has a lot of baby aloes that pop out.</p>
<br>
<h4>Fruit Fruit</h4>
<p id="fruitfruit"> Another plant i have is named "Fruit Fruit" we named it Fruit Fruit because it's like the devil fruits from One Piece. It's a satsuma owari orange tree that we bought at the farmers market. It's currently planted and growing at a friends house though because we didn't have enough space at our own apartment to keep it since we don't have a yard.</p>
<br>
<h4>Name is being decided</h4>
<p id="notknownyet">This plant is an albino balloon flower plant! It's pretty special because it came from my purple balloon flower that self seeded. I don't know what to name it yet but the original purple balloon flower was named "Petal Puff"</p>
